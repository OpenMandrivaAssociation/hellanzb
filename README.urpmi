Thanks for installing the Mandriva package of hellanzb. To configure
the client for use, copy /usr/share/doc/hellanzb/hellanzb.conf.sample to
$HOME/.hellanzb.conf and edit it appropriately. To start hellanzb, just
run 'hellanzb -D'. To enqueue nzbs, drop them in the queue directory as
configured in your $HOME/.hellanzb.conf.

If you want Hellanzb to automatically unrar downloaded files, install
the 'unrar' from the Mandriva Non-free repository.
